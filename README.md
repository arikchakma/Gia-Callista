# Gia-Callista
It's a javascript utility library for working fast &amp; we're making it better day by day. 

# Instalation
1. Using node package manager:
    ```shell
    npm i gia-callista
    ```
2. Using yarn
    ```shell
    yarn add gia-callista
    ```

## Then
```javascript
// You can import simply the Gia object or one by one ->
import Gia, { logger } from 'gia-callista';

// Simple logger
logger('Gia RockedðŸ¤˜');

// Getting viewport's height & width
const {x: height, y: width} = Gia.getViewportSizes();
```

## Sync between Locomotive-scroll & Gsap
Believe me, creating a relation between locomotive scroll & gsap is really a tough job and hard to understand. While building one of our client's sites, I discovered this solution which was really hard to understand for a beginner. We build this function so that every single one can create a sync process between locomotive scroll & gsap. Btw it's easy to use. Just follow the following code:
```javascript
import './locomotive-scroll.css'
import gsap from "gsap";
import ScrollTrigger from "gsap/ScrollTrigger";
import { getLocoScroll} from 'gia-callista';

gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger);

/*
* 00. getLocoScroll receives a object as parameters {element, speed}
* 01. Element - your main scroll container, if you don't wanna pass anything just put a className as 'smooth-scroll' in your main body/section.
* 02. Speed - It's the speed or sensitivity of the scroll.
*/
const locoScroll = getLocoScroll({
    speed: 0.5, // default 1
});

// Your remaining animation and code here
// Create magic here.

// Finally at the last
ScrollTrigger.addEventListener("refresh", () => locoScroll.update());
ScrollTrigger.refresh();
```

Thank you, Good Luck :)
